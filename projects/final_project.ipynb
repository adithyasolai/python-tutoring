    "The Final Project is a chance for students to use all parts of the Data Science workflow in one project:\n",
    "- Data Scraping/Collection w/ BeautifulSoup\n",
    "- Data Transformation/Manipulation w/ Pandas & NumPy\n",
    "- Data Visualization w/ matplotlib & seaborn\n",
    "- Machine Learning & Hypothesis Testing w/ scikit-learn\n",
    "\n",
    "The Final Project is very open-ended, and only has the following instructions and requirements: \n",
    "- Find any dataset on the internet that interests you. You can scrape data or simply download a .csv file. It doesn’t matter.\n",
    "- Ask 2-3 questions about the dataset. These are the hypotheses that you will test later. \n",
    "  - Ex: “How does variable Y change as variable X changes?”\n",
    "  - Ex: “I predict that variable Y will go up as variable X goes up because...”\n",
    "- Create data visualizations that help give some insight in answering your questions.\n",
    "- Run a Linear or Logistic Regression (or any other Machine Learning method you learn on your own) to conduct some hypothesis testing on your initial questions.\n",
    "- Write a conclusion about what the results of your hypothesis testing indicate.\n",
    "  - Were you right or wrong about your initial hypotheses/questions?\n",
    "  - Were you able to find statistically-significant evidence to support your hypothesis?\n",
    "  - What further steps can be taken in future studies to answer your questions?"
