    "## Motivation & Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "There are numerous reports and studies done about how the NBA has transformed in the past 5 years in regards to the 3-pt shot. The 3-pointer started to become dominant and popular in the NBA following the success of Stephen Curry and his Golden State Warriors (2015, 2017, & 2018 NBA Champions). Here are some great videos and articles about the **\"Three Point Revolution\"**:\n",
    "\n",
    "  -https://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/21/sports/basketball/how-the-nba-3-point-shot-went-from-gimmick-to-game-changer.html\n",
    "  \n",
    "  -How Data Changed the NBA by The Economist (Houston Rockets & Second Spectrum): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUvvfHkXyOA&ab_channel=TheEconomist\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "-As discussed in the resources above, Data Science & Analytics made coaches, players, and team executives comfortable with adopting the 3-pointer. **Now, we will use Data Science to test if those decisions paid off and are responsible for more wins.**\n",
    "\n",
    "-In this study, I will **calculate and compare the predictive power of 3-pointer-related Season Average Player  Statistics (3PFG%, 3PFGA, etc) in predicting NBA Regular Season team win-pct** in different eras of the 21st century.\n",
    "\n",
    "-The four eras will be 2000-2004, 2005-2009, 2010-2014, and 2015-2019.\n",
    "\n",
    "-I will only use data from players that are \"Starters\" because they have outsized impact on their team's Win% and are enabled to take a wider array of shots. I define a \"Starter\" as a player that starts >= 50% of games in a season for their team, which is the same way that the NBA defines \"Starter\" when determining who is a non-\"Starter\" to award the 6th Man of the Year award."

    "## My Questions/Hypotheses\n",
    " \n",
    "-**Confirm the narrative:** are players actually attempting more 3-pointers as time goes on? (a Simple Linear Regression: 3FieldGoalAttempted ~ Year)\n",
    "\n",
    "-Are players becoming more efficient 3-point shooters as time goes on as a by-product of the global increase in 3-pointers attempted? (a Simple Linear Regression: 3FieldGoal% ~ Year) My rationale for this is that efficient 3-point shooting has likely gotten more valuable to teams due to my first hypothesis about more 3-pointers being attempted overall, meaning teams will opt to choose players with higher 3-point efficiency over time as their Starters.\n",
    "\n",
    "-I hypothesize that **3-pt player stats (3-pointers attempted, 3-pointer efficiency, etc) will be statistically significant** even when considering all of the other box score player stats **for ALL 4 eras**. (a Multiple Linear Regression: Win%~All Player Stats)\n",
    "\n",
    "-Primarily, I am interested to see whether the predictive power of 3pt player stats starts to **OUTWEIGH and DOMINATE** the other player stats traditionally regarded as having the most predictive power (FG%, TREB, AST, etc) as time goes on."

This is to help see better patterns in 3FGA, as non-starters probably won't see a noticeable increase in 3-pointers attempted since they don't get many shots per game to begin with. Use the definition of starter used to determine the 6th Man of the Year award (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Sixth_Man_of_the_Year_Award). To not be considered a \"Starter\", you need to start in less than 50% of games for your team. Therefore, we will define starter as players that start in >= 50% of games. We will create a new column `start_pct` by dividing `GS` column by `G` column, and use this to filter out rows.\n",

    "The white dots in each violin represent the Median 3-Pt Attempts Per Game for that year. By following these white dots, we can see there is a linear positive trend. There is relatively steep increase from the year 2013 to 2014 and onwards, which is right around the time the \"Three Point Revolution\" began to be noticed and implemented across the league.\n",
    "\n",
    "The violins also show that 3-Pt attempts were right-skewed in the early 2000s, since the violins were fatter and wider towards the bottom and became skinner at the larger 3-Pt Attempt numbers on the y-axis. This means that most players were concentrated around a lower # of 3-Pt shots attempted per game, and a relatively few number of players took many 3-Pt shots.\n",
    "\n",
    "This right-skewed pattern continues until 2014, when the violins start to look bi-modal for 2014, 2015, and 2016. This means there is a large concentration of players taking few 3-Pt shots and an equally large concentration taking relatively more shots, with few in the middle.\n",
    "\n",
    "In 2017, 2018, and 2019, the violins become very skinny and don't have any noticeable peaks/skewness, which represents a more uniform distribution. By 2019, we can start to see a new trend emerging where there is a single peak/fatness in the middle of the violin near the median.\n",
    "\n",
    "(The needle-like tops of the violins are caused by a few specialist outlier players that are likely star players or very efficient 3-Pt marksman that are allowed to take more 3-pointers than most players in the league. We can see these players have existed to some extent in all years. The extent to which these specialist players shoot more 3s is different, however. We can see the outlier specialist players in 2016 and onwards take considerably more 3s than the outlier specialist players from years like 2009-2012.)\n",
    "\n",
    "We will have to do a formal Linear Regression and t-test to determine if this linear trend from about 2 3-Pt Attempts on average (median from 2001 violin) to about 4 3-Pt Attempts on average (median from 2019 violin) is statistically significant."

    "The outliers in these violins make it harder to make out a linear trend. The outliers of players with near-100% and near-0% efficiency is caused by starters who take very few 3-pointers despite being starters. Some examples of SUPERSTAR-calibar players that could still fall under this outlier category are: Shaquille O'Neal, Dwight Howard, and Ben Simmons. These types of players probably took 1-2 3s an entire season and either made them all (100%) or made none (0%).\n",
    "\n",
    "However, the median white dots show that median 3-Pt efficiency in 2001 was about 32%, and this figure was close to about 38% in 2019. From my domain knowledge, I think this change is pretty significant, especially since the peak, peak theoretical 3-Pt efficiency humanly possible is about 50% in my opinion (which is still really high). We will have to do a formal Linear Regression and t-test to confirm that this is statistically significant.\n",
    "\n",
    "Over time, the violins become fatter towards the median and form a clear single peak. This indicates more and more players in the league are able to shoot at a similar 3-Pt efficiency around the median over time. The violins in the early 2000s, by comparison, are much skinnier and uniform, meaning 3-Pt efficiencies are all over the place.\n",
    "\n",
    "I am not sure if \"linear\" is the best way to characterize these trends, however. We see the white dots go up from 2004-2009, then dip down until 2013, and then consistently go up until 2019. In future studies, it would be helpful to get data from more years (say 1980-2000) to see if these ups & downs are not significant in the overall trends."

    "**Conclusion Preamble**\n",
    "\n",
    "Before addressing our questions from the beginning of this study, let's discuss how to interpret and compare the Linear Regression results from the 4 eras. It is hard to use coefficients to compare across eras because, although they are all efficiency metrics, the `3P%`, `2P%`, and `FT%` predictors use shots taken as the standardizer, while the other predictors use minutes played. Additionally, these coefficients are hard to use and interpret like we did with our Simple Linear Regression with just one predictor. This is because all of these predictors are in the range 0-1 (0%-100%), and our standard tactic of talking about the change in response after 1 unit of increase in the predictors does not make sense because 1 unit of increase is a whole 100%.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's just keep things simple and use the sign of the coefficients (positive or negative) and the magnitude of the p-value (analogous to and derived from the t-statistic) to help make comparisons and observations. A smaller p-value indicates STRONGER evidence to reject the null hypothesis, making predictors with relatively smaller p-values less likely to not actually be a significant predictor compared to other predictors. Read more about the exact definition and interpretation of p-values here: https://www.statsdirect.com/help/basics/p_values.htm.\n",
    "\n",
    "Also, it is important to remember that the `efPTS` predictor is not highly-correlated with `3P%`, `2P%`, and `FT%`, since the former is based on minutes played, and the latter is based on shot attempts. Obviously, minutes played and shot attempts are themselves related, but overall this is not as big of an issue as predictors directly derivable from other predictors.\n",
    "\n",
    "**CONCLUSION**\n",
    "\n",
    "My hypothesis that 3-point efficiency would be a significant predictor of success in ALL ERAS was WRONG! As per the results above, 3-point efficiency only became a significant predictor in eras 3 & 4 (2010-2019). I think this result is indicative of the growing power of the 3-point shot. In eras 1 & 2 (2000-2009), the list of significant predictors was much smaller than later eras, and was largely made up of predictors that strictly related to just putting the ball in the hoop to score more points to win more games (points scoring efficiency, 2-pointer scoring efficiency, assists efficiency). In the more recent eras, however, 3-point efficiency started to become significant in its own right even in the context of these staple predictors.\n",
    "\n",
    "My other hypothesis regarding to what extent 3-point efficiency DOMINATES other predictors is hard to tell with this approach. Although `3P%` does have a lower p-value compared to other predictors in the later eras (3 & 4), I still don't feel comfortable using that as a definitive measure. However, I can at least see that 3-point efficiency has become MORE dominant/important as time goes on because of the observations for our other hypothesis question."
