# python-tutoring

**Written by Adithya Solai**

This is a self-serve, self-paced Python curriculum. Read `Adithya's Python Curriculum.pdf` to get a high-level breakdown of the curriculum.

I originally used this curriculum to do private 1-on-1 Python lessons. I have open-sourced this material for everyone to use. I have tested this curriculum as a self-serve educational tool by giving it to my Univ. of Maryland CS Undergrad mentees. They found it useful, and I hope you do as well.

Lessons 1-4 cover basic Python concepts that are found in most other programming languages (variables, operators, logic flow, for-loops & while-loops, lists, sets, dictionaries, Objects, etc.). Make sure to do the Problem Sets associated with each Lesson (example: Problem Set 1 should be done after completing Lesson 1). Each Problem Set also has an answer key (`/problemSets/answerKeys` directory). The exercises inside of Lessons also have a separate answer key (`/lessons/answerKeys` directory). There are also Projects (read `Adithya's Python Curriculum.pdf` to learn the appropriate time to do each Project).

The main value of this curriculum comes from the data analysis content in Lessons 5-7, Problem Set 5, Projects 3 & 4, and the Final Project. It's harder to make educational content on data analysis tools than on the vanilla Python concepts covered in Lessons 1-4. The goal of this curriculum is to make you comfortable with common Data Analysis tools (NumPy, Pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, sklearn, etc.) and have 3 personal projects that you can display on their GitHub & Resume (Project 3, Project 4, and Final Project).

My approach to this content is to make you **learn by doing**. There is some example code given in Lessons 5-7, but the associated Problem Sets and Projects emphasize using Google to learn what needs to be learned to solve the task at hand.
