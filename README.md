# python-tutoring

**Written by Adithya Solai**

This is a self-serve Python curriculum. Read `Adithya's Python Curriculum.pdf` to get a high-level breakdown of the curriculum.

I originally used this material to do private 1-on-1 Python lessons. I have open-sourced this material for everyone to use. I have tested using this curriculum in a self-directed, self-serve manner by giving it to my Univ. of Maryland CS Undergrad mentees. They found it useful, and I hope you do as well.

The main value of this curriculum comes from the data analysis content in Lessons 5-7, Problem Set 5, Projects 3 & 4, and the Final Project. It's harder to make educational content on data analysis tools than on vanilla Python concepts. The end goal of this curriculum is to make the student comfortable with common Data Analysis tools (NumPy, Pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, sklearn, etc.) and have 3 personal projects that they can display on their GitHub & Resume (Project 3, Project 4, and Final Project).

My approach to this content is to make the student **learn by doing**. There is some example code given in Lessons 5-7, but the associated Problem Sets and Projects emphasize using Google to learn what needs to be learned to solve the task at hand.
