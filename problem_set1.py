## Problem 5 ##
# Write a floor function for integer division.

## Problem 6 ##
# Write a ceiling function for integer division.
# You can't use "//", which would make this much easier.

## Problem 7 ##
# Write a function that determines if an NBA player is eligible
# for the Basketball Hall of Fame.
#
# You are given three variables about the NBA players:
# Number of Championships Won (`champ`, an int)
# Number of Points Scored (`pts`, an int)
# Number of Rebounds (`reb`, an int)
#
# A player is eligible for the Basketball Hall of Fame if they have
# won at least 4 championships OR have at least 1 championships won,
# at least 5000 points scored, and at least 3000 rebounds.

## Problem 8 ##
# Write a function that returns the employee level of a given
# Software Engineer (SWE) at a large tech company.
# 
# You are given two variables about the Software Engineer:
# Years of Experience (`yoe`, an int)
# Projects Completed (`pc`, an int)
#
# Return "SWE III" if the Software Engineer has more then 5 years of
# experience and has completed at least 100 projects
#
# Return "SWE II" if the Software Engineer has at least 2 years of
# experience and has completed more than 20 projects
