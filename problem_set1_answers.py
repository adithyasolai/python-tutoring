## Problem 1 ##
# Find the remainder of 1234 / 10 and print it
x = 1234
print(x%10)

## Problem 2 ##
# Find the remainder of 1234 / 100 and print it
x = 1234
print(x%100)

## Problem 3 ##
# Find the remainder of 1234 / 1000 and print it

## Problem 4 ##
# Write a floor function for integer division.
# You can't use "//", which basically does this for you.

    # `number` and `divisor` will only be integers >= 1.
    return None

## Problem 5 ##
# Write a ceiling function for integer division.
# You can't use "//", which would make this much easier.
def ceiling(numer, divisor):
    # `number` and `divisor` will only be integers >= 1.
    return None
