## Problem 5 ##

# Randomly-generate a move for the computer.
# The student can decide how to format the user input, and can expect that 
# the user will always follow that format.
#
# This will be evaluated manually by just playing the game a bunch of times.

## Challenge Problem 1 ##
# Write a function for matrix multiplication A * B.
# You can assume matrix A has dimensions m x n,
# and matrix B has dimensions n x p, where m, n, and p >= 1.
# Matrix A & B are represented using 2-D lists.
#
# Example of Matrix Multiplication:
# A = [[2, 4, 6],
#      [1, 1, 1],
#      [5, 5, 5]]
#
# B = [[5, 7],
#      [1, 0],
#      [0, 2]]
#
# A * B = 
#
# Linear Combination of Row 0 of Matrix A with Col 0 of Matrix B:
# (2 x 5) + (4 x 1) + (6 x 0) = 14
# ^^ 14 is now the value at Row 0 Col 0 of the resulting Matrix ^^
#
# Linear Combination of Row 0 of Matrix A with Col 1 of Matrix B:
# (2 x 7) + (4 x 0) + (6 x 2) = 26
# ^^ 26 is now the value at Row 0 Col 1 of the resulting Matrix ^^
#
# Linear Combination of Row 1 of Matrix A with Col 0 of Matrix B:
# (1 x 5) + (1 x 1) + (1 x 0) = 6
# ^^ 6 is now the value at Row 1 Col 0 of the resulting Matrix ^^
#
# Linear Combination of Row 1 of Matrix A with Col 1 of Matrix B:
# (1 x 7) + (1 x 0) + (1 x 2) = 9
# ^^ 9 is now the value at Row 0 Col 0 of the resulting Matrix ^^
#
# Linear Combination of Row 2 of Matrix A with Col 0 of Matrix B:
# (5 x 5) + (5 x 1) + (5 x 0) = 30
# ^^ 30 is now the value at Row 0 Col 0 of the resulting Matrix ^^
#
# Linear Combination of Row 2 of Matrix A with Col 1 of Matrix B:
# (5 x 7) + (5 x 0) + (5 x 2) = 45
# ^^ 45 is now the value at Row 0 Col 0 of the resulting Matrix ^^
#
# Final Result: A 3 x 2 matrix
#
# [[14, 26],
#  [ 6,  9],
#  [30, 45]]

## Challenge Problem 2 ##
# Use input() + while-loops to design a Blackjack game.
# Read the rules of Blackjack here: https://bicyclecards.com/how-to-play/blackjack/
# Play a few rounds here to get a feel for the game: https://games.washingtonpost.com/games/blackjack
#
# Notes:
# -You only need to account for Hit and Stand. You don't need to implement splitting and doubling bets
# -User starts with $1000. You must remember and update this value as the user plays more rounds.
# -If the user ever hits $0, you must immediately stop the game.
# -Assume every round the user bets $100. If they win, the user gets an additional $100 to their total.
#  If they lose, they lose $100. If they tie, they don't lose or gain any money.
# -You can keep it simple and count Ace only as 11, instead of both 1 and 11 like in real Blackjack.
# -You don't need to worry about printing suits (Clubs, Spades, Diamonds, Hearts) and ranks (Jack, Queen, King, Ace). 
#  You can just use the integer values to represent the cards:
#  2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 10, 10, 10, and 11. (There are four 10s b/c 10, Jack, Queen, and King all have a value of 10)
#
# ** This will be evaluated manually by playing a bunch of rounds and reading your code. **
# 
#
# EXTRA CHALLENGE:
# Implement the things that you didn't have to worry about before (Suits, Ranks, Ace dual-values, Splitting & Double-Bet, etc.)
# These new features will likely require using Object-Oriented design with user-defined classes. This will be covered in Lesson 4.
